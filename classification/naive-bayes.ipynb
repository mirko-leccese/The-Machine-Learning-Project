    "\n",
    "In Machine Learning, classification algorithms are methods used to predict a characteristic or \"label\" of a given object. Most traditional methods are **supervised learning** techniques, meaning they utilize a training set of labeled data to learn how to predict new data. Often, classification problems involve binary classification, where we need to determine whether a given property is met or not. Common examples of **binary classification** problems include predicting whether a human tissue sample is cancerous, determining if a financial transaction is fraudulent, or identifying whether an email is spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many algorithms that can be applied to binary classification, but in this notebook, we will specifically focus on the so-called **<span style=\"color: red\">Naive Bayes</span>** method, which leverages the principles of **Bayesian statistics**. In particular, we will code a class to perform Naive Bayes on text data and apply it to the well-known example of *predicting whether an email is spam*, often referred to as **<span style=\"color: red\">Bayesian Filtering</span>**."

    "Let suppose to have a set of emails $X$ labeled as \"spam\" or \"not spam\". For the sake of notation, we use the letter $x$ to denote a text email and the letter $y$ to denote the binary label, i.e. $y=1$ means \"spam\" while $y=0$ means \"not spam\". According to the **Bayes Theorem**, we could write:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(y|x) = \\frac{p(x|y)p(x)}{p(y)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "that is, the probability of label $y$ given a text $x$ for the email, $p(y|x)$, can be computed from the probability $p(x|y)$, i.e. the probability of a having a text $x$ given the email is spam or not. In the above formula, the term for which we may have a good estimate right from the problem definition is the **prior** probability $p(y)$, i.e. the probability of being spam or not. Indeed, if $N$ is the total number of email and $N_1$, $N_0$ denote respectively the number of spam and not spam emails in the dataset, then \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{gather}\n",
    "p(y=1) \\approx \\frac{N_1}{N} \\\\\n",
    "p(y=0) \\approx \\frac{N_0}{N} \n",

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "The problem, however, is that we do not know neither the probability $p(x|y)$ or the $p(x)$ probability, i.e. the probability of observing a given email text, regardless its nature. We may dispose of knowing $p(x)$ if we accept of quantifying just the following ratio:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R(x) = \\frac{p(y=1| x)}{p(y=0|x)} = \\frac{p(x|y=1)}{p(y=1)} \\frac{p(y=0)}{p(x|y=0)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Thus, we may decide that the email is spam whenever $R(x)$ exceeds a given threshold $t$. Of course, if $t$ is too large, our algorithm will be too conservative and classifiy spam emails as not spam. On the other hand, if $t$ is too small, the algorithm will overclassify emails as spam. Nevertheless, the problem remains the estimate of the $p(x|y)$ probability. The **Naive Bayes** approach looks for an approximation of such prior, simplying the problem by introducing the hypothesis of statistical indpendence between words. In other words, we assume the following form:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(x|y) \\approx \\prod_{i=1}^{n_x} p(w^{i}| y)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $w^{i}$ denotes the $i$-th word in text $x$, $n_x$ denotes the total number of words in text $x$ and the sum runs over all words in text $x$. Writing such probability as a product of $p(w^i|y)$ probabilities amounts to the assumption of statistical independence between words. Of course, this is a strong assumption and may not be true in general, but in most cases it provides a good approximation of the prior probability. To estimate $p(w^i|y)$ we can use a frequentistic approach, i.e.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(w^i|y=1) = \\frac{\\sum_x^N \\sum_j \\delta_{ij} \\delta(x;y=1)}{\\sum_x^N \\sum_j \\delta(x;y=1)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\delta(x;y=1)$ is a shortand notation to indicate $1$ if the text $x$ has label $y=1$, otherwise 0. Therefore, in the numerator, we sum $1$ for each document $x$ and each word $j$ if the $j$-th word of text $x$ is the word $w^i$ and the text has label $y=1$. The denominator is simply the total number of words in texts labeled as $y=1$.  Similarly, we can estimate $p(w^i|y=0)$. "

Indeed, with such refinement, once trained the model on $X, Y$, we may use the estimated conditional probabilities to classify texts containing words not available in the dictionary, without the need of re-training each time. Of course, in real-life scenarios, it may useful to re-train after some time as the training set gets larger.\n",

    "The **76.1%** of emails in the dataset is classified as \"not spam\", while the **23.9%** as \"spam\".

We have a lot of \"positive\" examples (i.e. spam) that can be used during the training phase. \n",

    "Before applying the naive Bayes approach and train our classifier, we must do some preprocessing. There is no standard procedure to follow in this phase. How to pre-process and what transformations to apply depends on the dataset we are working on. Here, we are working on a \"toy\" dataset that does not need too much preprocessing, but in real life situation this phase may be time-consuming and also critical for subsquent training. Below, we code and apply a function to *clean* the email text. In particular, here we will limit to:\n",
    "1. Convert any word to lowercase;\n",
    "2. Removing **stop words**. Stopwords are words such articles, conjuctions, prepositions, etc. which do not have any particular semantic meaning and so they may be not relevant for classification.\n",
    "In some applications, it may useful to remove also numbers and special characters but for the case of \"spam/not spam\" emails, the presence of numbers or non-alphabetical characters may be more frequent in spam emails than not spam."

The formula is:  $$A  = \\frac{(TP+FN)}{(TP+FN+FP+TN)}$$\n",
    "- **precision**: it defines how many of the positive predicted cases are indeed positive. Therefore, it is metric that stictly depends on the number of *False positive*. If you want to minimize *False positive*, it is the right metric to consider. The formula is: $$P = \\frac{TP}{TP+FP}$$\n",
    "- **recall**: it defines how many of the actual positive cases the model were able to predict. It thus depends on the number of *False negative*. It's the right metric to pick if you want to minimize the False negative, e.g. in medical scenarios where you don't want to classify a patient as healthy (negative) when he/she is not. The formula is: $$R = \\frac{TP}{TP+FN}$$\n",
